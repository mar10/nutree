Data Model
----------

A :class:`~nutree.tree.Tree` object is a shallow wrapper around a single, 
invisible system root node. All visible toplevel nodes are direct children of
this root node. |br|
Trees expose methods to iterate, search, copy, filter, serialize, etc.

A :class:`~nutree.node.Node` represents a single element in the tree. |br|
It is a shallow wrapper around a user data instance, that adds navigation,
modification, and other functionality.

Main `Node` attributes are initialized on construction:

parent (`Node`, readonly)
  The direct ancestor (``node.parent`` is `None` for toplevel nodes).
  Use :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.move_to` to modify.

children (`List[Node]`, readonly)
  List of direct subnodes, may be empty.
  Children are added or removed using methods like
  :meth:`~nutree.tree.Tree.add`,
  :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.prepend_child`,
  :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.remove`,
  :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.remove_children`,
  :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.move_to`, etc.

data (`object|str`, readonly)
  The user data payload. 
  This may be a simple string or an arbitrary object instance. |br|
  Internally the tree maintains a map from `data_id` to the referencing `Nodes`.
  Use :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.set_data` to modify this value. |br|
  The same data instance may be referenced by multiple nodes. In this case we 
  call those nodes `clones`.

data_id (int, readonly):
  The unique key of a `data` instance. This value is calculated as ``hash(data)`` 
  by default, but can be set to a custom value. |br|
  Use :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.set_data` to modify this value.

meta (dict, readonly):
  :class:`~nutree.node.Node` uses 
  `__slots__ <https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html?highlight=__slots__#slots>`_ 
  for memory efficiency.
  As a side effect, it is not possible to assign new attributes to a node instance. |br|
  The `meta` slot can be used to attach arbitrary key/value pairs to a node. |br|
  Use :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.get_meta`, :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.set_meta`, 
  :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.update_meta`, and :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.clear_meta`,  
  to modify this value.

node_id (int, readonly):
  The unique key of a `Node` instance. This value is calculated as ``id(node)`` 
  by default, but can be set to a custom value in the constructor.
  It cannot be changed later.

kind (str, readonly):
  Used by :class:`~nutree.typed_tree.TypedNode` (see :ref:`Typed child nodes <typed-tree>`).

.. General API
.. -----------

.. `Nutree` tries hard to allow developers to focus on their `data` objects instead 
.. of nodes.
.. Simple strings or arbitrary object instances can be added and looked-up::

..   # Add a plain string as toplevel node
..   team_node = tree.add("Team")

..   # Add an object as as child node
..   jane = User("Jane")  
..   team_node.add(jane)
..   ...
..   # Lookup by data object, in this case a plain string
..   assert tree["Team"] is team_node
  
..   # Lookup by object instance
..   jane_node = tree[jane]  # similar to tree.find(jane)
..   assert jane_node.data is jane

..   # Lookup by name (assuming the string representation of 
..   # the `User` instance is 'Jane'):
..   jane_node = tree.find(match="Jane")

.. It is also possible to lookup by custom keys if objects define them.
.. Read :doc:`ug_objects` for details.

.. `Nutree` also supports the case where multiple nodes reference the same `data` 
.. instance with mehods like
.. :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.find_all`,
.. :meth:`~nutree.node.Node.is_clone`, etc. |br|
.. Read :doc:`ug_clones` for more.
